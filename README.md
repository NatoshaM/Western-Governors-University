# Western-Governors-University

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics from Western Governors University (WGU) through their fully online, competency-based program. This unique format allows students to complete program requirements independently while receiving guidance and support from WGU faculty. Each six-month term requires completing at least 12 competency units (typically equivalent to three or four credits per course), but there’s no cap on how many units students can complete per term. This flexibility enabled me to accelerate my studies and complete my degree within two years.

The program is thoughtfully designed and continually updated with input from the WGU Analytics Advisory Board, a group of industry experts dedicated to ensuring that the curriculum remains relevant, practical, and impactful.

The Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics program is structured to develop expertise in three critical areas:

  * Programming Skills: Scripting, data management, data wrangling, Python, R, machine learning, and systems thinking.
  * Mathematical Skills: Statistical analysis, probability, discrete mathematics, and advanced data science techniques.
  * Business Influence Skills: Leadership, communication, critical thinking, data visualization, change management, design thinking, and storytelling.

My time at WGU was a transformative experience. It was challenging and often pushed me to my limits, but I’m incredibly grateful for the journey. The program equipped me with invaluable skills, and I would wholeheartedly recommend WGU to prospective students seeking a flexible, high-quality education in data analytics.
